# Factor-Backtesting-Functions
This program contains a framework for backtesting factors in R. It is highly flexible and allows for backtesting of any factor. I plan on estimating transaction costs, optimizing, and creating filters for factor weights. Furthermore, I will allow for quintile visualization and statistics used to analyze factor performance. As far as I am aware, no libraries exist for this purpose in R. This is still in development, however it will be finished soon. Finally, I will hone its efficiency.
